[cache]
# Cache strategy determines when to refresh holiday data
# Options:
#   - "TimeBased": Refresh based on max_age_hours
#   - "EtagBased": Check server's ETag header for changes
#   - "Hybrid": Combine both time-based and ETag-based strategies (recommended)
#   - "AlwaysRefresh": Always download fresh data (not recommended)
#   - "NeverRefresh": Never refresh, only use cached data
strategy = "Hybrid"

# Maximum age of cached data in hours before refreshing
# Default: 168 hours (7 days) - aligns with weekly data source updates
# Only applies when strategy includes "TimeBased" or "Hybrid"
# Note: Holiday data is typically updated annually in February, so weekly checks are sufficient
max_age_hours = 168

# How often to check ETag in hours
# Default: 24 hours (1 day) - balances freshness with minimal server load
# Only applies when strategy includes "EtagBased" or "Hybrid"

# Force refresh holiday data on every startup
# Warning: This will make network requests every time you run the application
# Not recommended for production use
